# Neural-Networks-Raw-Cpp
This repository is dedicated to building neural networks from scratch in raw C++, which means we will implement all the necessary components, including data preprocessing, weight initialization, feedforward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. By working with the fundamental building blocks of neural networks.
